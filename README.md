# Scrabble with JavaScript!
We are going to rebuild our Scrabble project using our knew knowledge of JavaScript.

This is an individual [Stage 1](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/pedagogy/blob/master/rule-of-three.md) project.

**Due:** Fri before class, 5/18

## Project Expectations

From the project root, you should be able to execute your code with `node scrabble.js`.  Each function you create should be a method of the `Scrabble` object.

### Project contents

This repository contains an empty node project which contains some structure to get you started. To finish setting up, go to the command line and run:

```
npm install
```

### Testing

This project contains a set of tests written using the Jest test framework. Use these tests to enable a test-driven development workflow. To run the tests use the command:

```
npm test
```

It will generate a code coverage report in a `coverage` directory.  

### Error Handling

Here is one question that's always worth asking: what should your code do when given invalid input?

There are many possible answers to this question, but according to the tests these methods should throw an exception. The syntax for doing so in JavaScript is a little different than in Ruby but the high level philosophy is the same. Go do some research and figure it out!

|Letter                        | Value|
|:----------------------------:|:----:|
|A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T  |   1  |
|D, G                          |   2  |
|B, C, M, P                    |   3  |
|F, H, V, W, Y                 |   4  |
|K                             |   5  |
|J, X                          |   8  |
|Q, Z                          |   10 |


## Wave 1

### Primary Requirements
Create the following methods within the `Scrabble` object.
- `score(word)`: returns the total score value for the given word. The word is input as a string (case insensitive). The chart below shows the point value for a given letter.
- `highestScoreFrom(arrayOfWords)`: returns **the word in the array with the highest score**.
    - Note that itâ€™s better to use fewer tiles, so if the top score is tied between multiple words, pick the one with the fewest letters.
    - Note that there is a bonus (50 points) for using all seven letters. If the top score is tied between multiple words and one used all seven letters, choose the one with seven letters over the one with fewer tiles.
    - If the there are multiple words that are the same score and same length, pick the first one in supplied list.

You should write your code in the Scrabble object. In addition to the provided tests, you should test the methods manually to ensure they work properly.

You can run your `scrabble.js` file by typing:

```bash
$ node scrabble.js
```

## Wave 2

### Primary Requirements
Create a new `Player` class within the `Scrabble` object. The class should have the following methods:

- Constructor: Called when you use `new Scrabble.Player(name)`, sets up an instance with the instance variable `name` assigned
- `name`: property which returns the value of the player's name
- `plays`: property which returns an Array of the words played by the player
- `play(word)`: method which adds the input word to the `plays` Array
    - Returns false if player has already won
- `totalScore()`: method which sums up and returns the score of the players words
- `hasWon()`: method which returns `true` if the player has over 100 points, otherwise returns `false`
- `highestScoringWord()`: method which returns the highest scoring word the user has played
- `highestWordScore()`: method which returns the `highestScoringWord` score

You will notice many of the tests for `Player` are incomplete.  You are expected to fill in the stubbed out tests.  

### Optional Enhancements
- Create a `Scrabble.TileBag` object that includes functionality that allows us to drawTiles and determine the remaining tiles.
Beginning Tile Quantities:

| Tiles per letter | Letters                   |
|:-----------------|:--------------------------|
| 1                | J, K, Q, X, Z             |
| 2                | B, C, F, H, M, P, V, W, Y |
| 3                | G                         |
| 4                | D, L, S, U                |
| 6                | N, R, T                   |
| 8                | O                         |
| 9                | A, I                      |
| 12               | E                         |

- Create a `Dictionary` class that includes a method for searching a list of words to determine if a given word is a valid word.
- Create a `Board` class that has a matrix (array of arrays) of tile places. Check if a word can be played on a given tile place in a certain direction.
- Using the existing tests as an example, write some tests for your optionals!
